# Executive Summary
The point of this lab is to make you familiar with what software is, and what it does for the computer. Also, to learn about what virtualization is and how it is beneficial in today's world of technology. To understand the difference this and cloud computing as well.

# Software 
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each. 
    * Operating system software acts as the interface between the programs and hardware of a computer. They essentially control the hardware. 
        * Examples = Microsoft Windows, Linux, macOS
    * Application software allows the end user to perform a certain task within the certain app. 
        * Examples = Microsoft Word, Excel, Zoom, Spotify
    * Utility software is used to manage the computer.
        * Examples = Backup tools, Antivirus, File management tools

* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example.
    * Enterprise Resource Planning is made to manage business processes, and automate background functions in these programs.
        * Example = Microsoft Dynamics


# Virtualization

Read the article 
https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization

* In addition to the chapter use the following resource:  https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html#how-it-works
and explain the purpose of virtualization. 
    * The purpose of virtualization is the eliminate the amount of processes on your local machine. This way, you can do extra tasks in a simulated environment.

#### Explain the following: 
* What types of problems are solved with virtualization? 
    * More processing power because you are using another machine, More space because you can store files on these machines as well. Virtualization also reduces the cost of not having to buy as many machines.
* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization? 
    * It plays as a virtual machine that you can access to do more tasks on, y9ou can also have different os environments at the same time. 

#### Cloud computing vs. Virtualization: 
    https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/cloud-vs-virtualization  
 
* In your own words explain the difference between cloud computing and virtualization  
    * Cloud computing is mostly just storage management. Virtualization includes actually being able to accomplish tasks within and perform work.

* Explain how a network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing? 
    * A network administrator could store network files in a cloud computing server to be able to easily access accross the network.
 
# Conclusion
Software is a very important part of a computer as well. They perform tasks and provide an interface for users. There is a lot to learn about virtualization and cloud computing. It is amazing all the resources that you can use that are server based and can be performed all from one machine.
