# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab was to elaborate on what type of guidlines do most organizations have and what they might entail. Also, we get more of a look into why registering a copyright can be helpful in the future. There is also an insight to some rules they have in regards to the internet, and who can recieve the specific data sent. This lab also gives you an understanding of what type of file paths there are and why some people might prefer compressed files.

# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.
 * The purpose of a code of ethics is to outline what the expected behavior for a certain group of people is. ACM created a code for computing discipline becasue they believe that people should have values, especially professionals who have access to a lot of people's devices.
* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.)
 * The difference between these is that when you join a group, usually a code of ethics is used. Whereas an AUP is more for the users of that resource.
* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 
 * I found out that Amazon has a AUP, which just goes over what they expect you to follow. Basically it states to not go against security, and do not do anything harmful, offensive, or illegal.
 * https://aws.amazon.com/aup/
## Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 
 * The purpose of WIPO is to lead the developement for IP services accross te globe. The importance of this is that they also aim towards protecting people's digital property.
* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created. 
 * A copyright is obtained the moment you create the object/work. The benefit of registering one is that there would be a public record which then you could bring to court if you were to sue someone for stealing your work. It is importnat to copyright a svg image incase someone tries to steal it and play it off as their own.
* If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 
 * A trademark works as a service mark for an indetifier, so it is used for designs, expressions, or signs.
 
## Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet. 
 * COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) restricts collection of data from people who are under the age of 13.
 * FERPA (Family Education Rights and Privacy Act) prevents educational institutions from releasing a students grades to anyone but the student and parent.
 * HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) grants parents the right to have access to their childs information, while also acting as a guidline for how school health services share their data.

# URLs and File Paths
* Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: 
Terms: scheme, domain, top level domain, default page, parameters, anchor 
Definitions/examples: .edu, no file path provided, result of search, https, www.amazon.com, specific location on a page.
 * Scheme - https
 * Domain - www.amazon.com
 * Top level domain - .edu  
 * Default page - result of search
 * Parameters - specific loaction on a page
 * Anchor - no file path provided
 
* What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why?
 * Absolute File Paths are a full website link that takes you to the desired site. Relative File Paths take you to a different part of the site that the link was located in. I would use both if I were to make a website. I can link outside websites that I would like readers to visit, and inside links to make it easier to get places within.

* Explain the purpose and use of file compression.
 * File compression is used for when you want a file to take up less space. Also so that it can be moved to another file location or another computer more quickly than an uncompressed file.

# Conclusion
There was quite a bit of information in this lab. I learned facts about internet collection rules that I was not aware of. There was also informative information about copyrighting your creative work and also using trademarks.
