# Executive Summary
The goal for this lab is to get a better idea of the elements of encrypting data and see how much cyber security matters and how it is put into place. Also, this lab introduces cryptography and how messages can be hidden. An insight is also given into what brute-force actually entails.  

# Cybersecurity and Encryption

* Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job
  * Confidentiality - Not sharing the person's information you are assisting
  * Integrity - Handling the issue at hand properly and in an honest manner
  * Availability - Having support be available to customers 24/7
* Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication
  * Accessing e-mail, logging onto your bank account, and logging into the computer. E-mail can become multi-factor and send the phone number on file a confirmation number to enter. Logging into your bank account, you can also have your phone or e-mail connected that sends you a one-time code to enter in to be able to log on, or even use a finger print to gain access. A computer requires a pin or passcode, and some can also confirm with facial recognition.
* Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
* Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key
* Explain why we need public key cryptography.

## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message.
Then explain the encryption here:

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result.
b) Would it be different for different languages?

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?"
Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word.
Explain the result.

## Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?

# Conclusion
