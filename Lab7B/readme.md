# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to get more familiar with identifying classes that include features and actions. This also wraps up final thoughts on the group projects that were completed.

# Object Oriented Programming
* Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following:
a) Phone
b) House
c) Employee
* Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make Model etc)
* Identify the actions (In the video for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc)
* Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to github for each of the above classes.

# Research Project
* Explain in 2 lines about your research project. Then answer each of the below questions.
  * My group research project was in regard to the cloud. This included how the cloud is utilized.
* How did you find your sources? What are sources that you should avoid when doing good research?
  * I found most of the sources from Google Scholar. Sources to avoid when researching are mostly blog websites.
* What did you find most useful about doing this project? What did you learn?
  * I found the easy communication with my group was the most useful. I learned that it is important to have this communication in any group project.
* What was the hardest part of doing this project?
  * The hardest part was finding reliable information that made sense to me.
* If a team member did not co-operate or had a different idea than yours, explain how you worked with that team member.
  I would just say that I am open to suggestions and I would want to hear what they think and figure out a middle ground.

# Conclusion
From this lab I got a better understanding of how object oriented programming works, what it is based off, and that it is a fairly easy concept. I also gathered my thoughts about what I took away from the group project that was asigned.
