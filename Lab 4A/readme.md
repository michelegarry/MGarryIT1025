# Executive Summary
This lab is to gain knowledge about what graphics images use to be represented on screen. Also, it is to learn the difference between file formats and what each of them is for. Lastly, there is also a lesson to get familiar with Command Prompt and what it can do.

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image. 
 * Raster images are made out of pixels, whereas vectors are made out of paths.
* Include examples of when each would be most appropriate 
 * A GIF and JPEG would be examples of Raster graphics, and a PDF would be an example of Vector graphics.

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats? 
 * This matters because when the lossles format is used for an image, the image keeps all of the data that it is made of, so it does not lose any quality. When a lossy format is used, the file size is reduced, therfore the image loses some of its quality.

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files. 
 * GIF files allow animated images, and also can have up to 256 RGB colors
 * JPG files uses lossy compression, can fine-tune amount of compression used, high contrast
 * PNG files uses loseless data compression, and includes transparency options, low contrast

# Operating Systems
Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

## Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks
* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required
 * There are 3 layers to the design for the pasta. The background image, the text, and then another image of the chefs.
* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)
 * The file size is 286KB, and it opens with the Photos app. I think Photos is the most appropriate for this.
 
# Conclusion
After this lab, the different types of formats were explained more into detail. I learned which format is appropriate for what, as well as the compression choice for the image. I also learned a bit mroe about command prompt, and what it can do with your computer. It is cool to see all the layers of a piece of art come together to create one image as well.
