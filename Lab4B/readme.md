# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to get familiar with the process of Flowcharts, and how they can be used to help develope code. Also, this lab teaches more about Networking and the key terms and hardware that are involved.

# LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number and then
* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10.
Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)
      * It was very easy to use and navigate when building the flowchart. I liked how easily you could fix mistakes, or move things around without messing up the flow. They also provide help with navigating the tools, if needed, which came in handy.

# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words & Definitions:
* Packet
    * Unit of data
* Packet-Switching
    * Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
* IP Address
    * Unique identifying number
* DNS
    * Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)
* Protocol
    * Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

## Network Hardware
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.
    * A switch can actually store the MAC addresses of each device, so when a data packet is sent, it only goes to the intended reciever, whereas a hub is not secure and sends it to each device connected.
* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.
    * A router can send data packets to an outside network, so it is essentially a network gateway. It can also read IP addresses of devices.

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.
    * Single point of failure is when a switch goes down, and all the devices connected go down with it. This can happen in star, ring, and bus topologies.
* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?
    * I think that the Wireless Mesh would be a better choice of the two. If one device fails, like a wireless access point, it does not affect any others in the area. Wheras with the Infrastructure Topology, that would probably affect other devices in the area.

# Conclusion
I enjoyed making the Flowchart. It gives a better understanding of the order that code must be written. I also find Networking quite interesting, I am going to school for Networking Hardware. It is a field where there is so much information that is changing throughout the years.
