# Executive Summary
This lab dives in to some of the protocols there are in the world of networking. It explains the protocol for the transfer of data over the internet, as well as internet security and how it works along with why it is important.

# Internet Architecture

## Internet Protocol
* What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
    * An Internet Protocol (IP) Address is the specific number assigned to a device on a network. IPv6 has a 128-bit address, therefore has many more available addressses to use vs IPv4 which is a 32-bit address.
* Find the IP address of your computer by typing ipconfig at the command prompt (refer back to the "Operating Systems" module for details.) 
  Take a screenshot of the command without including the IP address to show your success, name the file ipconfig and upload to the lab folder on GitHub. 
* What is ICANN and how do they contribute to the global Internet? 
   * ICANN = Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. They contribute to the global internet because they organize all of these names and numbers all over the world.

## TCP/IP

#### Review the first article and answer these questions:
* What is the responsibility of TCP/IP? 
   * The responsibility of TCP/IP is to determine how data is sent over netowrk / networking hardware.
* Explain how the client-server model applies to TCP/IP. 
   * The client needs to know the IP of the server it wants to communicate with, this determines how the client computer sends data over to the server.

#### Review the second article and answer these questions:
Review the section of the article aligning the post office with protocol stacks.  
* Why are layers important to changing technology? 
   * Layers are important to changing technology because splitting a task into layers as such, there are more ways you can then improve a process in each step.
* What types of applications run on the "application" layer?
   * The types of apps to run in the application layer include apps that access the web, and e-mail applications.

# Internet Security
#### Watch the video and answer these questions:
* What is HTTP and how does it support the client-server model? 
   * HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol used when viewing any website on the internet. It supports the client-server model because the client sends data over the internet that then travels to the server and back. 
* Explain the protocols that secure HTTP uses to protect data. 
   * HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP, uses SSL (secure sockets layer). This uses public key encryption, and also provides a certificate for the level of security it provides. HTTPS also uses TLS (transport layer security) which authenticates client and server, while also encrypting data.

#### Review the following article: Securing Your Web Browser 
* Why should you secure your browser? 
   * If your browser is not secure, there is a way higher chance for spyware/malware to be downloaded on your computer and cause all sorts of problems. Your data may also be at a higher risk of getting stolen if the browser is unsecure.
* Explain one of the risks described in the article. 
   * Sometimes if a web browser is unsecure, a virus can surpass the anti-virus software one may have on their machine.
 
# Conclusion
In the world of technology, security is a very serious issue. It is important to have protocols in place to try and make the internet more secure, and less chance of your information getting stolen. It is important to know what is in place to keep order with your data that is being sent over the internet.
