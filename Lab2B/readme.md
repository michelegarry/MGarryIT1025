# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to get familiar with logic gates and how they function. This way you can identify the outcome. Also, this lab is introducing how to read hexadecimal color representation and learning about using the right one in web design.

## Hexadecimal color representation
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ 
  * This representation of hexadecimal equals the color pure violet. (67.1% red, 0% green, 100% blue).
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. 
  * This color could be problematic becasue it might strain someone's eyes, looking at it as a background color. It can clash easily with another color as well. Also, since the saturation is 100%, this might make it difficult to differentiate for color blind users.

## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.
  * A truth table is meant to display the rule of the specific gate, and list the possible inputs, and outputs.
  * If the input is 1 and 1, so both on, the output is off (0). Every other input would equal to 1 (on).   
* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? 
  * The outputs of a NAND gate are the opposite of the AND gate.
* Complete the logic gate exercises word doc and upload to this folder.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
  *
