# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to recognize and be able to describe the functions of computer hardware. That way you know what is inside of a computer, and what each part is responsible for.

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
    * Latency 
* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?
    * The major difference between a Hard Disk Drive and an SSD is that a Solid State Drive does not have a spinning disk where it reads and writes data on. It stores the data immediately on the memory chips. There is less latency with SSD's becasue the information can be accessed right away.
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
    * In a computer, when the RAM is completely full, your actively used data gets processed then through the hard drive (the virtual memory). Increasing the RAM makes it so that the computer will not slow down as much because it will not keep accessing multiple places for this short-term data if you have enough RAM.
* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?
    * A 64-bit system can deal with more data at once, and process more than a 32-bit system can. Also, a 32-bit machine can only handle 4GB of RAM, whereas a 64-bit can handle way more than that.

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers 
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)
* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)
* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)

# Conclusion
Reflect on what you have learnt from this week
