# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to recognize and be able to describe the functions of computer hardware. That way you know what is inside of a computer, and what each part is responsible for.

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
    * Latency in terms of hard drive performance is the time delay from the initial request for data and the return of it. Transfer rates are the speed that the data is transferred to the hard drive.
* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?
    * The major difference between a Hard Disk Drive and an SSD is that a Solid State Drive does not have a spinning disk where it reads and writes data on. It stores the data immediately on the memory chips. There is less latency with SSD's because the information can be accessed right away.
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
    * In a computer, when the RAM is completely full, your actively used data gets processed then through the hard drive (the virtual memory). Increasing the RAM makes it so that the computer will not slow down as much because it will not keep accessing multiple places for this short-term data if you have enough RAM.
* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?
    * A 64-bit system can deal with more data at once, and process more than a 32-bit system can. Also, a 32-bit machine can only handle 4GB of RAM, whereas a 64-bit can handle way more than that.

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU
   * The control unit receives the instructions from the RAM, to which it then sends the mathematical operations tasks to the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) which performs the task, and then depending on the circumstance, outputs the answer.

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output
   * The example addresses the input as a letter/number/symbol you press on your keyboard. Then, this keystroke request gets sent to the CPU in a binary form. The CPU then requests instructions on how to display this from the memory. After the CPU gets instructions on how to display the letter, number, or symbol from the memory, it then gets translated from binary to lights/colors that appears on the screen as output.

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers
   * Decimal number system goes by a base of 10, so it has 10 digits that represent numbers. So each numerical place holder is a power of 10. 
   * Binary has a base of 2, so it has 2 digits it uses to represent numbers. Each numerical place holder is a power of 2. 
   * Hexadecimal number system has a base of 16, so 16 digits are included in this system. Each numerical place holder has a power of 16.
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)
   * = 11010011
* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)
   * = 362
* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)
   * = C0
# Conclusion
There was quite a bit covered this week in regards to hardware and numeric conversions. I was not too familiar with latency and transfer rates beforehand. I did not know that the ALU existed before this either. It was cool to learn how to convert decimal to binary and hexadecimal. The hexadecimal numeric system was cool to learn, I had never heard of this before. It's amazing how much there is to learn out there about the world of computers.
